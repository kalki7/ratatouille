In a large bowl, whisk together the egg white, sugar, oil and vanilla. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Beat the butter in a large bowl with a mixer on medium speed until creamy, about 3 minutes. With the mixer running, gradually add the sugar, 1/2 cup at a time, and mix until well incorporated. Add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until the cake is puffed and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool completely. (The cake can be made up to this point 1 day ahead. Store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature.) Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
